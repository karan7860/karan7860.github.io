* **Baker Hughes, Mumbai**

  I started working here after my Masters, since July 2018. I have worked as an Digital Technology Intern with Baker Hughes as Leadership and Pipeline Program for a year. Currently I'am working here as Software Engineering Specialist and Project Scrum Master. Here I have worked on gathering software requirements from stakeholders and customers and implementing multiple projects based on cloud-computing, industrial analytic models, on-cloud deployments and server side development. Along with a small team, I have also accomplished a novel idea based on deployment of Analytic models and have been the lead inventor of a provisional patent, the company has proceeded with filing at the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
