Hi, I am Shreyas Lele. I am currently working with Baker Hughes in their elite Aspire Leadership Program as a Software Engineer. I have completed my B. Tech in Information Technology from VJTI, Mumbai.  

I am interested in Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Cloud Based Analytics, developing intelligent bots and want to explore the Artificial Intelligence domain.

I have successfully completed projects based upon Reinforcement Learning, Time series forecasting, Neural Machine Translation. I have industrial experience in server-less cloud computing and cloud based analytics. I have accomplished end-to-end projects from intial designing, to production ready on-cloud deployment. 

Apart from that, I like playing various sports and love to travel. I relish playing guitar and piano. I also enjoy computer gaming.
