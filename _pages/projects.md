* **IIoT for Monitoring Oil well production to ensure reliability**

  IIOT integration has been a ultimate growth factor for multinational companies especially in Oil and Gas industry. Using IIOT and digital analysis of raw data, the industry leaders can beforehand know the overview architecture and the technologically complex frameworks with ease and whether the equipments work in a proper condition without having to go onsite production location. As a result, we a robust connectivity system that manages and interconnects all the sensor statistics which are already installed onsite, without having to visit manually by any site engineer. We need robust and reliable connectivity to ensure the live time series data can be fetched and analyzed without any unforeseen delay. Due to this framework, the owner of the oil and gas sites can readily the performance and monitor the equipments visually and can focus on degradation of any specific module of framework. This study presents an application of a multi- variate regression model to estimate the future production performance of oil wells based on monthly-production time series data. Several engineering techniques that require expertise and data that are difficult to obtain are used currently to predict well performance. In this report, focus is on how innovative networking standards and protocols are enabling revolutionary system-building approaches that greatly ease field operations, how to predict, forecast the value of oil production over time under different condition


* **Cloud Based Mobile Social TV**

  Everyone in day to day world wish to have mobiles with newly updated versions and features. People donâ€™t want to lack any of the advance features of the mobile. New mobile accessory shops are everywhere with mobiles and tablets. The limited battery life time of mobile devices and much variation in wireless connectivity, which makes the highest possible quality of service experienced by mobile users are unfeasible, made the highest demand of mobile to come down. The design of a Cloud-based novel Mobile social TV system (Cloud MoV) utilizes both PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) and IaaS (Infrastructure- as-a-Service) cloud services to offer the living-room experience of video watching to a group of mobile users. Video is encoded at server side. These videos are stored in online web hosting server. In CloudMoV, mobile users can import a live or on-demand video to watch from any video streaming site like YouTube, Vimeo, U stream etc. and invite their friends and family for watching the video concurrently. They can also chat with each other while enjoying the video.
  
* **Microservice Based Artificial Intelligence Framework for executing and Deploying Industrial Analytics using K8S and ISTIO**

  This project was an organizational patent project to provide a framework for executing analytics.
  
* **Serverless Cloud Computing using AWS Lambda Functions for Timeseries Data Ingestion**

  This project was an organizational project which uses AWS resources to provide optimal data ingestion.
