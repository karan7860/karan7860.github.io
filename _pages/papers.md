* **Forecasting flow-rate for oilwell using autoregressive model**

  This project was an independent project. I applied the ARIMA model on the flow-rate data for the oilwell to forecast the future values. I used Principal Component Analysis for the dimentionality reduction. The corresponding paper was accepted in  Elsevier's SSRN eJournals.
  
* **Anomaly detection using Unsupervised learning**

  This project was an independent project. I used Isolation Forest, Mahalabois distances to find the anomalies in the well-head pressure sensors data. The results were published in the International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology (IRJET).
  
* **Virtual musical instruments**

  This project was taken in the intial phase of undergrad. The objective was to create virtual drums and keyboard, in such a way that the user can play it by just moving the hands in air. We used the Microsoft Kinect for visual feedback and motion detection. We created gloves with infrared sensors connected to Arduino uno microcontroller for obtaining the users' finger flex as he plays the virtual keyboard.  

* **ABU Robocon**

  As a team, we participated in the ABU Robocon national competition. We desgined a robot for completing a frisbee challenge. The visual feedback for the frisbies was obtained using a normal webcam. The bot was driven by an ATmega 128 mcrocontroller. For movement, infrared sensors based line-following was achieved.
